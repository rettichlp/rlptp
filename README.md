# The Rettington Aesthetics

This project is a custom Minecraft resource pack originally created for personal use, but also shared with the community. It blends the
best elements of well-known packs:

- [**BetterVanillaBuilding**](https://bettervanillabuilding.com/) – famous for its seamless textures, perfect for creative building,
  including connected textures and block variations that enhance structural detail.

- [**Excalibur**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/excal) – a medieval-inspired texture pack with rich colors and hand-crafted
  details, giving Minecraft a warm and immersive atmosphere.

- [**Default Dark Mode**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/default-dark-mode) – a dark-themed variation of
  Minecraft's default textures, providing a sleek and modern aesthetic while maintaining the original game's feel.

- [**Cubic Sun & Moon**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/cubic-sun-moon) – a cubic design for reimagined sun and moon, adding a
  unique visual element to the Minecraft sky.

The goal is to merge the building flexibility and visual variety of BetterVanillaBuilding with the atmospheric, hand-drawn style of
Excalibur and some additional textures. This combination creates a consistent and harmonious look while improving the overall gameplay
experience.

In addition to the blended textures, the pack also includes a few personal and humorous "Radish"-themed changes – for example, a
modified hunger bar and a custom in-game painting.

The pack is regularly updated to match personal preferences and maintain compatibility with the latest Minecraft versions. While
designed primarily for private use, it is freely available for anyone to download and enjoy.
